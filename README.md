# Cyber Siege

## Overview
**Cyber Siege** is a web-based hacking simulation game designed to train players in real-world cybersecurity practices. Players engage in missions that teach both offensive (red team) and defensive (blue team) hacking strategies. After completing training, players compete in a dynamic "SOC vs Hacker" environment, simulating real-world cybersecurity scenarios.
