## Core Mechanics

### Command Execution

Many actions in Cyber Siege are performed through a simulated command-line interface:

1. Type commands in the terminal window
2. Use proper syntax for the command to execute successfully
3. Review command output for valuable information
4. Chain commands together for more complex operations

### Resource Management

Both Red and Blue teams must manage limited resources:

- **Processing Power**: Determines how many simultaneous operations you can run
- **Bandwidth**: Affects data transfer speeds and reconnaissance capabilities
- **Tools**: Specialized software with unique capabilities and limitations
- **Time**: Most operations take time to complete, requiring strategic planning

### Detection Systems

Actions in the game generate different levels of visibility:

- **Stealth Operations**: Minimal chance of detection but slower execution
- **Standard Operations**: Balanced approach with moderate detection risk
- **Aggressive Operations**: Fast execution but high chance of detection

### Risk vs. Reward

Every action carries potential consequences:

- More powerful attacks are easier to detect
- Stronger defenses may impact system performance
- Aggressive strategies may yield quick results but leave you vulnerable
- Conservative approaches provide security but may limit your capabilities
